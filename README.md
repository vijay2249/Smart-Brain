This app uses Clarifai Face Detect API for the process.
So for this app to work make sure that you have your own clarifai api key 
Get it from here [Clarifai](https://www.clarifai.com/).
Also create your own API key in that website.

After getting your own api key follow the steps below:

1. create a new config.js file in the src folder

2. then create an object keys with key value as CLARIFAI_API_KEY and your api as value

The code in your config.js at the end should be

    export const keys = { CLARIFAI_API_KEY : "YOUR API KEY HERE" }

replace YOUR API KEY HERE with your API key.

In this code i used my own api key by creating a new file and storing adding the file to gitignore file so you can't see it..


This app just recognises the face in a picture

Also the local files cannot be accessced due to security

Input url better end with image extensions(with either jpg or jpeg or png)

More features to come near by.

### Run the commands:

1.`npm install`

## Note:
Not updating the gh-pages branch is intentional considering there is chance to steal API key

This is to mention that this is just the frontend app and also have to get image response from clarifai to display the required information in the site

This means that since there is no server, the request has to be send from the user system to clarifai with an API which is injected somewhere inside the code

Else we cannot get the response clarifai for the image or atleast send the image to clarifai to get the response from them

Just waiting to see if anyone finds this glich

_If you found it please do not repeated the same mistake as I did while creating your app_

## Currently this app is in the fly but there will be no response and the main functionality is off as the API key used in creation of the frontend part is deleted ðŸ˜‰
_Gotta be careful once you find the glitch in your app_
